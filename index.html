        <h1>Information Sheet for Study Participants</h1>
        <h2>Study Title: <i>Reward and Aversion Discounting</i></h2>
        <h3>Who is conducting the study?</h3>
        <p align='left'>
        We are scientists from the Department Clinical Psychology directed by Prof. Dr. Peter Kirsch 
        at the Central Institute of Mental Health, Mannheim, Germany. This study aims at developing and 
        validating decision-making tasks with a representative sample of participants. 
        Participants are volunteers who are recruited on survey platforms and who will be reimbursed 
        for the time taken to complete this study.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Why is this study being done?</h3>
        <p align='left'>
        We are investigating how future events influence 
        decision-making processes. The primary aim of this study is to find choice patterns 
        in situations where participants have to decide between smaller immediate and larger 
        delayed monetary wins or losses. Studies have shown that participants with addiction 
        problems consider future rewards to a lesser degree. In our studies, we wish to 
        extend this to decisions between aversive options. The study you are participating in 
        is designed to refine the behavioral tasks that will be used for future studies in our 
        laboratory. This servers to further understand how aversive and rewarding events 
        are processed in decisions between immediate and future events.
        </p>
        
        <h3>What will happen in this study?</h3>
        <p align='left'>
        If you agree to be in this study, you will complete the experiment online 
        using your web browser. On the next pages, the task will be explained in detail.
        The task consists of two conditions where you have to decide between two <b>imaginary</b> 
        amounts of money: in one condition, 
        you have to decide between a smaller immediate win or a larger win in the future. 
        In the other condition, you have to decide between a smaller immediate loss or a larger 
        loss in the future. The amounts of money and the temporal delay for the future option 
        (in days) will be varied. Trials of both conditions will be displayed in random order. 
        Half-way through the experiment, you will be asked to fill out several 
        questions regarding your demographics, your behavior in specific situations and your 
        consumption of alcohol.
        </p>
        
        <h3>How long will the study last?</h3>
        <p align='left'>
        Participation in this experiment will take place over one session and will last 
        <b>between 30 and 45 minutes</b>.
        </p>

        <h3>Will you be compensated for participating in this study?</h3>
        <p align='left'>
        In compensation for your time, you will receive <b>£6.50 per hour</b> via Prolific 
        once you have completed the experiment.
        Other than the compensation you receive, there is no direct benefit to you from 
        participating this study. However, you are contributing to scientific progress and 
        society may benefit from the knowledge that is acquired in this experiment.
        </p>
        
        <h3>What are the potential risks associated with this study?</h3>
        <p align='left'>
        Participation in this study is not associated with any risks. 
        If you experience any discomfort you may withdraw from the experiment 
        at any time by closing the browser.
        </p>

        <h3>Are there any costs associated with participating in this study?</h3>
        <p align='left'>
        There will be no cost to you for participating in this study.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Who will handle my data and what are their qualifications?</h3>
        <p align='left'>
        The following research staff involved will have access to your 
        personal and research data: Prof Dr Peter Kirsch, Dr Georgia Koppe, 
        Dr Janine Thome, Mr Patrick Halli and Mr Mathieu Pinger. This study is part 
        of the Collaborative Research Centre TRR265: Losing and Regaining Control over 
        Drug Intake, a trans-regional collaboration funded by the Germany Research Foundation (DFG).
        For more information, visit 
        <a href="https://sfb-trr265.charite.de/en/" target="_blank">https://sfb-trr265.charite.de/en/</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p align='left'> 
        Other qualified personnel from the Department of Clinical Psychology and the trans-regional 
        research collaboration may handle your data, including graduate students and research assistants. 
        For all individuals that handle your data, regular data security seminars are mandatory.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Information about data protection</h3>
        <p align='left'>
        All data will be handled in accordance with the DSGVO 
        (General Data Protection Regulation Act, 2016). 
        The experiment is hosted on a secure internet connection (with a https certificate) and the 
        data is encrypted and stored on a secure server which is under the administration of the 
        IT department of the Central Institute of Mental Health. 
        Personal data (e.g., any communication you send us via email about the experiment) will be stored 
        separately from your research data (e.g., age, sex, gender, education, ethnicity, alcohol consumption, 
        decision-making in the tasks). You will be assigned a random participant ID and be known only by this ID. 
        Your personal data and your research data will not 
        be linked. Therefore, your research data are stored anonymously. 
        The personal data that you may provide (e.g., your personal email address due to contacting 
        us via email) will be securely and temporarily stored during any correspondence on a  
        protected email account hosted at the Central Institute of Mental Health under the 
        administration of the IT department of the Central Institute of Mental Health. 
        Once any correspondence is completed the correspondence alongside your 
        email address will be deleted. We believe that sharing data openly is good scientific practice, 
        so your anonymized research data may later be shared with other researchers and research funding 
        bodies via data sharing services (e.g., The Open Science Framework, 
        The German Research Foundation (DFG), etc.). 
        For that reason, the data will be stored indefinitely. Because your data are anonymous and we will 
        not able to tell which data belongs to you, we will also not be able to 
        delete your data if you request it.
        </p>
