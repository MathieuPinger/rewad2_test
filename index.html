        <h1>Information Sheet and to Act as a Research Subject</h1>
        <h2>Study Title: <i>Reward and Aversion Discounting</i></h2>
        <h3>Who is conducting the study? Why have you been asked to participate?
        How were you selected? What is the approximate number of participants in the study?</h3>
        <p align='left'>We are scientists from the Clinical Psychology department directed by Prof. Dr. Peter Kirsch 
        at the Central Institute of Mental Health, Mannheim, Germany. This study aims at developing and 
        validating decision-making tasks with a representative sample of participants. 
        Participants are volunteers who are recruited on survey platforms and who will be reimbursed 
        for the time taken to complete this study.</p>
        
        <h3>Why is this study being done?</h3>
        <p>We are interested in monetary decision-making. 
        The primary aim of this study is to find choice patterns in situations where participants 
        have to decide between smaller immediate and larger delayed monetary wins or losses. 
        The secondary aim of this study is to explore the relationship between monetary 
        decision-making and alcohol consumption.</p>
        
        <h3>What will happen in this study?</h3>
        <p>If you agree to be in this study, you will complete this experiment online 
        using your web browser. You will perform multiple blocks of two decision-making 
        tasks where you have to choose between two imaginary amounts of money: in one task, 
        you have to decide between a smaller immediate win or a larger win in the future. 
        In the other task, you have to decide between a smaller immediate loss or a larger 
        loss in the future. The amounts of money and the temporal delay for the future option 
        (in days) will be varied. After half of the blocks, you will be asked to fill out several 
        questions regarding your demographics, your behavior in specific situations and your 
        consumption of alcohol.</p>
        
        <h3>How much time will each study procedure take, what is your total time commitment, 
        and how long will the study last?</h3>
        <p>Participation in this experiment will take place over one session and will last 
        <b>between 30 and 45 minutes</b>.</p>
        
        <h3>What are the potential risks associated with this study?</h3>
        <p>Participation in this study is not associated with any risks. 
        However, you may experience discomforts, e.g. frustration, boredom 
        and/or fatigue while participating in our study. But if you experience 
        any discomfort you may withdraw from the experiment at any time by closing the browser.</p>
        
        <h3>Who will handle my data and what are their qualifications?</h3>
        <p>Only the following research staff involved will have access to your 
        personal and research data: Prof Dr Peter Kirsch, Dr Georgia Koppe, 
        Dr Janine Thome, Mr Patrick Halli and Mr Mathieu Pinger. This study is part 
        of the Collaborative Research Centre TRR265: Losing and Regaining Control over 
        Drug Intake, a trans-regional collaboration funded by the Germany Research Foundation (DFG).

        <p>Prof Dr Peter Kirsch is the Principle Investigator of the Department of Clinical Psychology 
        at the Central Institute of Mental Health and has attained a PhD in Clinical Psychology. 
        Dr Georgia Koppe is Principle Investigator of the research group Computational Psychiatry 
        at the Central Institute of Mental Health and has attained a PhD in Psychology. 
        Dr Janine Thome is a Post-doctoral scientist in the Computational Psychiatry research group 
        at the Central Institute of Mental Health and has attained a PhD in Psychology. 
        Mr Patrick Halli and Mr Mathieu Pinger are PhD students in the Department of Clinical Psychology 
        at the Central Institute of Mental Health. 
        Other qualified personnel from the Department of Clinical Psychology and the trans-regional 
        research collaboration may handle your data, including graduate students and research assistants. 
        For all individuals that handle your data, regular data security seminars are mandatory.</p>
        
        <h3>Information about data protection</h3>
        <p>All data will be handled in accordance with the DSGVO (General Data Protection Regulation Act, 2016). 
        The experiment is hosted on a secure internet connection (with a https certificate) and the 
        data is encrypted and stored on a secure server which is under the administration of the 
        IT department of the Central Institute of Mental Health. 
        Personal data (e.g., any communication you send us via email about the experiment) will be stored 
        separately from your research data (e.g., age, sex, gender, education, ethnicity, alcohol consumption, 
        decision-making in the tasks). You will be assigned a random participant ID and be known only by this ID. 
        Therefore, your research data are stored anonymously. Your personal data and your research data will not 
        be linked. The personal data that you may provide (e.g., your personal email address due to contacting 
        us via email) will be securely and temporarily stored during any correspondence on a password 
        protected email account hosted at the Central Institute of Mental Health under the 
        administration of IT. Once any correspondence is completed the correspondence alongside your 
        email address will be deleted. Sharing data openly is good scientific practice, so your anonymized 
        research data may later be shared with other researchers and research funding bodies via data 
        sharing services (e.g., The Open Science Framework, The German Research Foundation (DFG), etc.). 
        For that reason, the data will be stored indefinitely. Because you	r data are anonymous and we will 
        not able to tell which data belongs to you, we will also not be able to 
        delete your data if you request it.</p>

        <h3>Who is responsible for processing my personal data?</h3>
        <p>Prof Dr Peter Kirsch is responsible for processing your data and can be contacted 
        using the following details.</p>
